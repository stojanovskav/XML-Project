            <description>The Dryanovo Monastery was established in the 12th century. The monastery was first built 2 km from the place where it is situated now. In 1393, the Ottoman Turks burned it down to ashes, in the 16th century, the local people restored it on the other bank of the river, but this time the holy monastery was also demolished.
                On the place where it is situated now, the monastery “St. Archangel Michael” exists from the end of the 17th century. In the monastery, there was an enormous library which turned it into one of the largest education centers during the Revival. The bandits who were acting in groups in the Ottoman Empire set the monastery on fire for the third time.
                In the 19th century, a renovation of the holy monastery began, residential buildings were constructed, and it was restored again.</description>
